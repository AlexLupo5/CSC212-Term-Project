Convex Hull

Problem/Solution:


**Requirements:
**Convex Hull to**
^^^

- find a way to save a visualization
  - can generate a DOT file

**_Read a set of points from a file_**

**Status Update to**
convexHull.cpp (version 3)
  * Added convexHull(), ~convexHull(), convertCordToVect(), struct Point
    * convertToPoint() - can read through a file and sort the x and y coordinates into point
    
  
**Status Update to**
convexHull.h (version 3)
  * Added to private: std::string fileName, std::vector<Point> points;
