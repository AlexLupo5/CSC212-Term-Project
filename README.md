# CSC212-Term-Project
**Project:
Convex Hull

Problem/Solution:


**Requirements:
**Convex Hull to**
^^^

**_Implement Grahamâ€™s Scan algorithm_**
- find a way to save a visualization
  - can generate a DOT file

**_Read a set of points from a file_**

**Status Update**
- For current working version of convexHull.cpp please download convexHull.cpp and convexHull.h to your program.
convexHull (version 4)
  * convexHull can be called in main by convexHull "name of object"("file name");
  * convexHull.cpp also allows the user to print the output to the terminal or to a dot file by either calling "name of object".print() or "name of object".dot() in the main.cpp file.
  * convexHull.dot and convexHull2.dot files can be visualized by using graph.cpp
  * convexHullGraphviz.dot file can be visualized by copying and pasting it into https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/

<h2 align="center">Setup Instructions</h2>

This project was created using CLion.

This project incorporates the SFML library for generating visualizations of a convex hull data structure from a dotfile. 

Our code prints Convex Hull points to the terminal and produces two different types of dotfiles for visualization purposes when given a file in the following format:
```
(x1,y1)
(x2,y2)
(x3,y3)
...
```

**INSTALL CLION:**

You can install CLion onto your computer using this link: [CLion Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)

1. Click the download CLion for your operating system.
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the provided instructions.
3. Once installed, open the software and sign in with a JB account.

Now CLion is installed and ready to use.

**INSTALLING SFML:**

The external library SFML was used in this project.

**MacOS:**

To download SFML for MacOS first you have to download homebrew

1. Use this link to go to the homebrew website: https://brew.sh/

2. On Homebrew's website the line below is provided:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Open the terminal on your computer and run the provided command

4. It should then download homebrew onto your computer.  If there are any errors, a warning will pop up on the terminal and give further instructions

5. Then after homebrew is downloaded type the following line in the computer terminal:
    ```
   brew install sfml
    ```
    
SFML will then be installed on your computer


**Windows:**

You can find the SFML official instructions on there website located [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/).
Below will be provided basic instructions on install

1. First navigate to the SFML download page [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/)
2. Select the dowload that works with your IDE
3.

**No SFML Required:**

In CLion, create a project using C++ 11, titled `INSERT PROJECT TITLE`.

  Ex: /Users/"Computer Name"/CLionProjects/INSERT PROJECT TITLE

1. Inside the `INSERT PROJECT TITLE` project, create the files `main.cpp`, `convexHull.cpp`, and `convexHull.h`.
2. Remove any content inside the files if there is any
3. Navigate to the GitHub repo `convexHull` directory and copy the `main.cpp`, `convexHull.cpp`, and `convexHull.h` files from the GitHub repository and paste them into the `convexHull` project files with the matching titles. For example, main.cpp -> main.cpp.
4. Remove the content of the `CMakeLists.txt` file and copy the `CMakeLists.txt` from the GitHub repository `convexHull` directory, then paste it into the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `convexHull` project.
5. The CMakeLists.txt logo should appear with two blue arrows going in a circle; click that, and it will refactor the CMakeLists.txt.
6. Before running the code, you may create a txt file using the command `touch (name of file).txt ` in the terminal.
7. After creating a text file, you may input your data in the text file with the format:

    ```
   (x1,y1)
   (x2,y2)
   (x3,y3)
   ...
    ```
8. In the `convexHull` project terminal, run the following line to compile the code:

    ```
    g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp convexHull.cpp -o gen
    ```
9. In the `convexHull` project terminal, run the following line to execute the code:

    ```
    ./gen (name of file).txt
    ```

    A dotfile will be created named `convexHullGraphviz.dot`. The terminal will output the Convex Hull points or an error message if it fails to construct from the text file values.
   

    The `convexHullGraphviz.dot` cannot be visualized with our SFML implementation and is meant to be copied and pasted into the Graphviz website ([Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/)).

**WITH SFML:**

In CLion, create a project using C++ 11, titled `INSERT PROJECT TITLE` with SFML:

  Ex:  /Users/"Computer Name"/CLionProjects/SFML/INSERT PROJECT TITLE

1. Inside the `INSERT PROJECT TITLE` project, create the files `main.cpp`, `convexHull.cpp`, `convexHull.h`, `graph.cpp`, and `graph.h`.
2. Remove any content inside the files if there is any
3. Navigate to the GitHub repo `convexHull with SFML` directory and copy the `main.cpp`, `convexHull.cpp`, `convexHull.h`, `graph.cpp`, and `graph.h` files and paste them into the `convexHull` project files with the matching titles. For example, main.cpp -> main.cpp.
4. Remove the content of the `CMakeLists.txt` file and copy the `CMakeLists.txt` from the `convexHull with SFML` directory, then paste it into the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `convexHull` project.
5. Also in the `CMakeLists.txt` in the project insert your project title where it is specified
6. The CMakeLists.txt logo should appear with two blue arrows going in a circle; click that, and it will refactor the CMakeLists.txt.
7. Before running the code, you may create up to three txt files using the command `touch (name of file).txt ` in the terminal.
8. After creating your text files, you may input your data in the text file with the format:

    ```
   (x1,y1)
   (x2,y2)
   (x3,y3)
   ...
    ```
  
9. After creating your data sets in the txt file(s), drag each text file into the cmake folder `cmake-build-debug` located on the left side of the project.
10. Next navigate to the top right of your project in clion and locate the three dots next to the debug button
11. Click on the three dots followed by `Edit...` where you can then input up to three text file inputs in program arguments:

    Ex: test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt
    
12. Then click the blue OK button at the bottom of the configurations
13. After closing out of the edit configurations tab, you are then able to run the code using the run button located at the top right corner of your project.

    Up to three dotfiles named `convexHull_#.dot` will be created depending on the number of file          arguments provided. The terminal will also output the Convex Hull points of each file.

    In the rare case that the dotfiles do not get automatically put into the cmake-build-debug:
    
    Drag the three desired `convexHull.dot` file(s) from the `convexHull` project and put them in the      `cmake-build-debug` folder in the `convexHull` project.
    ```
    convexHull_#.dot
    ```
    Then in the top right corner of CLion, press the run button again.
