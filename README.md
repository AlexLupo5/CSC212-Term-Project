# CSC212-Term-Project
**Project:
Convex Hull

Problem/Solution:


**Requirements:
**Convex Hull to**
^^^

**_Implement Grahamâ€™s Scan algorithm_**
- find a way to save a visualization
  - can generate a DOT file

**_Read a set of points from a file_**

**Status Update**
- For current working version of convexHull.cpp please download convexHull.cpp and convexHull.h to your program.
convexHull (version 4)
  * convexHull can be called in main by convexHull "name of objext"("file name");
  * convexHull.cpp also allows the user to print the output to the terminal or to a dot file by either calling "name of object".print() or "name of object".dot() in the main.cpp file.
  * .dot file can be visualized by using the (graphics .cpp) or by copying and pasting it into https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/

**Instructions**
1. Copy convexHull.cpp (version 4) and convexHull.h (version 4) into your program IDE of choice.
2. continue here (graphics library instructions)
